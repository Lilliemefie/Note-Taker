## Description
In this busy world, we always forget to do the important thing. 
Note Taker will help the user to organize and track of tasks that need to do/be complete.

This application allows the user to write notes, and saves them to the webpage. 
Even thought the user close the browser and reopen the page, the saved note is still there.
If the user no longer need the saved note, then the user can delete it.
